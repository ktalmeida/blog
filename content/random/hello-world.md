#### Just messing around
Hello guys, my name is Kayan and I'm a developer from Rio de Janeiro. Graduated in Computer Engineering in Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and worked in many different and exciting development projects.

I've been developing mostly Android, Node, Django and hacking some OpenWRT routers. Curious learner in blockchain technologies, machine learning and IOT. :smile:

Nice to meet you, feel free to contact me to talk about awesome ideas!
